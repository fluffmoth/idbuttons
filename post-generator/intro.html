			[columns][size=4]The old post surpassed the character limit, so here's a new thread to break up the masterlist! The original thread can still be found [url=https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/cc/2468452#post_2468452]here[/url].

			<br>I made these for my dragon bios, but feel free to use them any way you want, on or off site! Credit is nice but not required. They're always free to use and request, but since I've been asked, I do have a [url=https://ko-fi.com/fluffmoth]ko-fi[/url] and am open to treasure/gem tips. If someone other than me fills a request for you, please consider tipping them! â™¥

			<br>[center][size=4][b]Disclaimer[/b][/size]
			<br>The inclusion or lack of inclusion of any specific button on the masterlist, or the way they are categorized, [b]should not be viewed as any kind of statement on my part.[/b] Anything without hateful intent will generally be allowed. The idea is that people can make their own choices and do their own research on how they wish to identify, regardless of my opinions or understanding of something. My goal is to create a useful community resource, not to pass any kind of judgement on what people should do. Some buttons may not be added to the list by accident or because of character limits and load times (though anything missing here is probably in the [url=https://idbuttons.neocities.org]database[/url]!)
			<br>
			<br>If you have any specific concerns, please contact me privately to discuss it! Even if your intentions are good, public posting on this type of thing can quickly overwhelm the thread.

If you would like to look for them in the offsite [url=https://idbuttons.neocities.org/database/?tags=religion]database[/url] you are free to do so, but please exercise caution to avoid violating FR rules. Other artists posting religion buttons here may be [url=https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/cc/3078623/161#post_55991414]personally liable[/url] for any discrimination reports they receive. Additionally, if you do choose to create religious buttons, please avoid [url=https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/cc/3078623/159#post_55982015]religious symbols[/url] and [url=https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/cc/3078623/161#post_55992024]Flight Rising IP[/url].
